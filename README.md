# number-guessing-game-analysis

### Overview

I made a project which shows how precisely program can guess numbers from 1 to 100. Scheme is as follows:  

1.Program creates variable "number" and initializes it with random number from 1 to 100.  
2.Program creates variable "guess".  
3.The goal is to make "guess" value equal to "number's" but without copying it.  
4.Program uses simple algorithm to find right number (each algorithm is located in separated class for convienence).  
5.Points 1 to 4 are repeated 50 times, then program stops and number of tries needed to find the "number" in every  
round is stored to text file.  

There is also a case in which I was a second player guessing program's "number".
